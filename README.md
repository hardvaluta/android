::Our Vision
To enable people both with and without the ability to read and write to learn swedish
through intuitive game experiences.


::Social contract
*Have at least one meeting a week in person.

*Continuous project updates are posted on our chosen forum.

*Everyone should participate. If a group member cannot participate, he/she should let the others know of this.

*If a group member misses a meeting or gathering, it is their responsibility to get up to date.

*Ask for help, instead of getting stuck.


::Backlog
Can be found on our public Trello board - https://trello.com/b/l0f1ql1E/android
