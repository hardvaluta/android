# android

For Hand-off:

The repo contains 2 folders, Android and Backlog. The android folder contains the application's code. The backlog repo contains the code for the database and server. All of our sprint reflections are available, so are the D1A and D2 documents. The app's apk is named app-release-unsigned.apk. Not any work has been done on the applicatin since the final presentation except some minor bugfixes. The out put from gitinspector and findbugs are most easily viewed using

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hardvaluta/android/blob/master/gitinspectorstats.html
for gitinspector

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hardvaluta/android/blob/master/findbugs_filter_r_file.html
for findbugs.

The name for the findbugs output is incorrectly named it actually doesn't filter out R.java file.
There is therefore also an image provided in the repo named findbugs_no_filter.png which is showing the output when the R.java file is filtered out. Note that the name for this file is also misleading.

DAT255_prototype_description.pdf generally discusses the application and how we solved some technincal difficulties.
DAT255_reflectkon_report.pdf is the reflection report.

::Social contract
*Have at least one meeting a week in person.

*Continuous project updates are posted on our chosen forum.

*Everyone should participate. If a group member cannot participate, he/she should let the others know of this.

*If a group member misses a meeting or gathering, it is their responsibility to get up to date.

*Ask for help, instead of getting stuck.
